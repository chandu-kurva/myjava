SCANNER CLASS
----------------

-Scanner is a predefine class(already defined) which is used to take 
 an input from user during runtime or Execution time.

-This Scanner class is used when we want to take inputs from user
  not from programmer.

-Steps to use Scanner class
---------------------------
1)Write first statement in program as
---------------------------------------- 
     import java.util.Scanner;
              OR
     import java.util.*;

-Reason: Since Scanner is a class which is present in java.util package.
-package:Package is like a folder where we can keep common classes together
         at one place
         Ex:Gallery
              |_family(folder)
              |_friends(folder)
              |_girlfriends(folder)
              |_something(folder)
-So in java if we are using any class of any package we must have to write import statement
-import: it is a keyword which indicates that we are using anyother class code
         in our own class.
2)Create an object of Scanner class
------------------------------------
  Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
-here System.in indicates that we are reading input from system.              

3)Using Scanner class reference call Scanner class methods
----------------------------------------------------------
methods of Scanner class are:
nextByte()   ------->For taking byte value as input
nextBoolean()------->For taking boolean value as input
nextShort()------->For taking Short value as input
nextInt()  ------->For taking integer value as input
nextFloat()  ------->For taking float value as input
nextDouble()  ------->For taking double value as input
nextLong()  ------->For taking long value as input
next()     ------->For taking String value as input without space
nextLine()------->For taking String value as input with space

Program
-------
//Scanner class
//step-1
import java.util.Scanner;
class StdDetails
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
  //step-2
  Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
  //step-3
   System.out.println("Enter name ");
   String name=s.nextLine();
   System.out.println("Enter age ");
   int age=s.nextInt();
System.out.println("Enter percentage ");
   float percentage=s.nextFloat();
  System.out.println("Enter result status ");
   boolean result=s.nextBoolean();
  System.out.println("Enter contact number ");
   long contact=s.nextLong();
  System.out.println("Student Details Entered by You are");
  System.out.println("Name: "+name);
System.out.println("Age  :"+age);
System.out.println("Contact :"+contact);
System.out.println("Score : "+percentage);
System.out.println("Result: "+result);
}}

Output:
C:\Docs\programs>java StdDetails
Enter name
John P
Enter age
23
Enter percentage
65.5
Enter result status
true
Enter contact number
9898989878
Student Details Entered by You are
Name: John P
Age  :23
Contact :9898989878
Score : 65.5
Result: true

Note-1:
-------
If we did not give the values properly while asking during runtime we will get 
 "InputMismatchException"
C:\Docs\programs>java StdDetails
Enter name
john p
Enter age
44.5
Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException

->Here age should be of integer type but we gave float type .


Note-2
-------
-We don't have any method called as nextChar() to take character as input
rather we have a method like 
next().charAt(0)------>To take character input i.e
-First we will enter string value from that it takes only first character 
  Ex: Entered value is---->Abcd
              Output is -->A


C:\Docs\programs>java StdDetails
Enter name
John
Enter age
23
Enter percentage
44.5
Enter result status
false
Enter contact number
987654321
Enter Gender
Male
Student Details Entered by You are
Name: John
Age  :23
Gender :M
Contact :987654321
Score : 44.5
Result: false
