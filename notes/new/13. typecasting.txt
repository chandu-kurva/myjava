Type Casting
----------------
-Converting one type of primitive datatype into another type of primitive 
   datatype is called as type casting
            OR
-Assigning one type of value into another type is called as Type casting.

it is divided into 2 types

1.Widening           2.Narrowing

Widening
-----------
-Converting smaller  primitive datatype into bigger primitive datatype is called
 as widening.

-Widening is also called as implict Casting

-byte--->short---->int---->long--->float----->double

-Since we are converting a smaller type into bigger type there is no loss of data.

Narrowing
----------
-Converting bigger  primitive datatype into smaller primitive datatype is called
 as Narrowing.

-Narrowing is also called as Explict Casting

-byte<---short<----int<----long<---float<-----double

-Since we are converting a bigger type into smaller type there is 
 loss of data.











Life cycle of Object
---------------------
-Objects can be created by using new keyword.

-If an object is no longer useful it is better to make that object as Abundon object.

-Objects whose control is no longer with programmer or object who does not have
  reference or Object who reference is nullified such objects are called as 
  abundon objects.

For Ex:
--------
Dog d1=new Dog();
Dog d2=new Dog();
Dog d3;
Dog d4;

  d3=new Dog();
  d4=d3;

d2=null;//abundon object
d1=null;//abundon object
Object casting:
--------------
-Converting one type of object into another type of object is called as Object casting.

-2 types
---------
1.Upcasting
2.Downcasting

Upcasting:
----------

-Converting subclass object type into super class object type is called as upcasting

                         OR

-create an object of subclass and store it into a reference of super class is called as upcasting

-During type casting only super class behviour is visible subclass behviour is hidden

Program
---------
class Police
{
	public void lockdown()
	{
		System.out.println("stay at home");
	}
}
class Boyfriend extends Police
{
	public void lockdown()
	{
		System.out.println("No matter whathappens i will go out for her");
	}
	public void meetingGirlfriend()
	{
		System.out.println("Want to see her only once");
	}
}public class USER {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Police p1=new Boyfriend();//upcasted object
		p1.lockdown();//compiles successfully
		//p1.meetingGirlfriend();//CTE because during upcasting subclass
                                            behaviour is notvisible.


-Since subclass contains the properties of super class upcasting is possible directly
  i.e superclass can hold the reference of sub class.
-SO upcasting is implict in nature.

Downcast:
---------
-Converting an superclss object type into subclass object type is called as downcasting

                          OR

-Converting an upcasted object into normal form is called as downcasting.

-During down casting both subclass and super class behaviour is visible

-since super class does not contains property of subclass directly downcasting is not possible
  explictly we have to convert it.

-so thats why downcasting is explict in nature.

-Only upcasted object is downcasted, i.e direct downcasting is not possible.

Program
-----------
public class USER {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Police p1=new Boyfriend();//upcasted object
		p1.lockdown();//compiles successfully
		//p1.meetingGirlfriend();//CTE
		 Boyfriend b1 = (Boyfriend)p1;  //Boyfriend b1=new Boyfriend()
		 b1.lockdown();
		 b1.meetingGirlfriend();
	}}
class Police
{
	public void lockdown()
	{
		System.out.println("stay at home");
	}
}
class Boyfriend extends Police
{
	
	public void meetingGirlfriend()
	{
		System.out.println("Want to see her only once");
	}
}

Examples
------------

                   Qspiders(APP)
                         Viewing       Editing
         Student          yes            No(hidden)//Upcasting
        
         Admin            yes            yes//Downcasting


                    Aeroplane
                            Tyres     Wings
         TakingOff          hidden    Visible//Upcasting

         Landing            Visible   Visible//downcasting

Tommorow's task is to create these two examples.
