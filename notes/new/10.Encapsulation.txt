ENCAPSULATION
-------------
-DEF:The process of wrapping the data member(variables) and memeber function
(methods) into a single unit(class) is called as Encapsulation.

-The main purpose of encapsulation is to achieve security of data.

What is the need of Encapsulation?

-we go for encapsulation to protect our data members from invalid user.

-For ex: if monthmum is not protected(Encapsulated) user may misuse the 
datamember by assigning invalid values.(like >12 or<1)

-If data member is not protected(public) it is under user control i.e user
will decide what values to assign but those values can be valid or invalid.





-if datamember is protected(private) it is under developers control to decide
which values to allowed.

purpose
---------
-protecting the datamembers by keeping them private and accessing through some
 special methods is nothing but Encapsulation.
Rules for Encap
--------------
1.Declare all data members as private(if a datamember is private it is not
  accessible outside of class)

2.define separate setter and getter methods(it's not mandatory to define only setter and getter
  we can define any useer define methods).

JAVA BEAN CLASS:
----------------
A class is called as java Bean class if all data members are private and there is separate
 setter and getter method for each data member.
setter method
----------------
-It is public in nature
-setter method doesnot have specific returntype
-setter method contains arguments same as data member
-name of method is set followed by data member name.
getter method
--------------
-It is public in nature
-return type must be same as that of data member
-name of method is get  followed by data member name.
-getter method does not have arguments.
Note:
----
For every data member we have to define seperate setter and getter method

Examples:
------------------
1.protecting bank details from an invalid user to access is an example of encapsulation

2.keeping a password for mobile to protect data is an example of encapsulation

3.Protecting an online docs by keeping password is an example of encapsulation.

4.securing house by keeping lock is an example of encapsulation.

Fully Encapsulated class
------------------------
-If all data members of a class are private and there is separate methods to access those data 
such class is called as fully Encapsulated class.

   class A
   {
      private int i;
      private float f;
      private String s;
     //methods to access them//
 }

Partially Encapsulated class
-----------------------------
-If any data members of a class is non private such class is called as partially Encapsulated class.
   
   class A
   {
      private String name;
      public int age;
    }

No Encapsulated class
--------------------
-If noneof  data members of a class is  private such class is called as NO Encapsulated class.
   
   class A
   {
      public String name;
      public int age;
    }

Advantages
-----------
-Securing the data 

-We can make our class as Write only by writing only setter method

-We can make our class as read only by defining only getter method
