String-string is predefine class which is present in java.lang package
--------
in java string is an
1.object
2.datatype
3.class
4.group of characters
***immutability
objects
--------
2 ways
1.using new keyword-2 objects will get created
   1. one is under heap area-reference var assigned to it
    2.another is under string constant pool-it is small part of
    heap area-no
   reference assign to it it is only for backup
   String s1=new String("Java");
   String s2=new String("java");
2.using literal:
first jvm will go to SCP and check is there any object present
 with string data 
if it is there it will assign reference to it ,if it is 
not there it creates new object and assign
reference
---------------
String s1=new String("java");
String s2=new String("java");
  String s3="java";
  String s4="java";

   so on
 String s100="java";
IMMUTABILITY
-------------
From above example we understood that for one string object 
there can be multiple reference
assign to it if we changes data of one string object
 it will effect to multiple
references thats why java says that string objects are 
immutable i.e once we 
created we cannot modify it.
Notes:
------
in the above example with new keyword 2 objects will get 
created one is under heap and another is under scp.
since concat operation is performed during runtime
concatinated object will get created under heap area

since there is no reference assign to concatiated object it is
eligible for deletion and garbage collector will delete
this object.

since s1 is refferring to java we will get output as java .
